# Abstract Algebra

additive inverses and mult inverses: 
    add or negative or minus is to add something with it's opposite, here we say inverse 
    the opposite for multiplacation is its reciprocal.

Groups: 
    - Operations * preformed on a group G element g stays in the group (closed under the opration)
    - inverses, or opposite elements
    - When opposites combine they form an identity
    - An identity combined with another element g is still g 
    - associativity

Semi-group: 

    a group which does not require inverses, or identities

Abelian Groups (commutative groups):
    - Groups that also hold under commutativity

Subgroup: 
    a subset of elements within a group G that is still a group
    Trivial ones:
    - {e}
    - G 
    For subgroup H, it is denoted H<=G "H is a subgroup of G" 

Cayley Tables: 
    Like multpilication tables, but generalized for elemnts of all groups

Legranges Theorem:
    That for group G, all subgroup orders must divide G.
    Proof: 
        take G, and subgroup H. Then H has the identity too 0G. Take 
        an element not in H but in G g1. Construct g1H. g1H will be 
        of order H, though share no common elements. As assume they did intersect, then 
        g1 * h1 = h2, however that must mean g1 = h1/h2 but that's in H, but g1 is not in 
        H. 
        If we continue to construct H until we can no more, order of cosets generated
        divide the order of the group. OTHER SUBGROUPS are just sets, not groups.
        The number of cosets is denoted the index of H in G : "|G:H|". 
        number of cosets = d, order of H = k, order of G = n, then 
        d*k = n. 

Normal Subgroups: 
    - N <= G such that it's cosets form a group, denoted N <|=G
        i.e., -yNy = N for any y in G 
    Proof: 
        take two cosets x*y in (xN)(yN)=xyN, take arbirtrary n 
        xn1*yn2 = xyn3
        -x*xn1*yn2 = -x*xyn3 
        n1*yn2 = yn3
        -yn1*yn2 = n3
        -yn1y = -n2n3

    Identity: N 
    Inverse: xN is -xN

Quotient/Factor Group:
    - subgroup H of G, such that G/H denotes H splitting G into cosets of order H. 
    THIS cannot form a group if H is not a normal subgroup. 

Simple Groups:
    - groups that only consist of the two trivial groups

Cyclic Groups:
    - If a group G is generated by a single one of its elements, then it is a Cyclic group
    There are finite and infinite 
    There are only two, 

    Infinite:
        Z, as <1> generates all Z 1, it's inverse, identity {-1,0,1} now all its repeated
        applications {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
    Finite: 
        Z/Zn form the only finite groups, which are just residue classes of n

    for [a] to generate Z/Zn gcd(a,n) must be 1
    and the trivial group {e}

Homomorphism: 
    Comparing two groups (G, *) and (H, ^),
    for a function 
    f: G -> H 
    x |-> f(x) 
    y |-> f(y)
    Then f(x*y) = f(x) ^ f(y)

    entries x and y in the cayley table map to an entries f(x) and f(y) in the H from G. So 
    so must their f(x*y), and in that entry must be f(x) ^ f(y)

    it is possible that many elements in G map to H

    __
    Map: inverses -> inverses and identities to identities
    

Isomorphism:
    A Homomorphism that is one-to-one and onto, i.e., Homomorphism is bidirectional from G to H.
    In otherwords they seem to behave identically under the caley table, where each elements map 
    perfectly to one another in entires.

    a copy of the group structure 

Kernel: 
    The set of elements in G, which all map to the identify of H. 
    This means G is not one-to-one and some elements x,...,y map to 1H 

    it can be thought of as: The kernel measures to which a group isn't 1-1 

    for example if g1=g2 as they both map to H then 
    g1-g2 = e. And g1-g2 = some element, therefore the identity along with 
    that element are in the kernel. 

    the number of duplicates equates the number of kernel order

    denoted ker(f) = {x in G | f(x)=1H}

First Isomorphism Theorem: 
    G/ker(f) cong(Isomorphic) img(f)


Order of an Element: 
    group G with identity e, x in G the order of x is the smallest positive integer 
    n such that x^n = e. Denoted |x|, not to be confused with absolute. If 
    no such n exists, it has infinite order.

    The order of any identity element is 1

Symmetric Groups: 

    Sn (S sub n), S tells us its symmetric and n tells us how many elements are in that set.
    This runs n permutations on such a set, the resulting set is n!, which is also it's order.

    compact form of 

    1,2,3,4 permutations 4,3,2,1 and 1,2,4,3, could be 
    f(1): 4
    f(2): 3
    and so on 
    g(1): 1
    g(3): 3 
    and so on 
    compactly represented as 
    (large parenthesis) 
    |1 2 3 4|     |1 2 3 4|
    |4 3 2 1|  *  |1 2 4 3|

    to do f of g and multply we follow, the composition. 1->1 in g, 1 in f-> 4 
    and so on 

    |1 2 3 4|
    |4 3 1 2| is the resulting multiplication 

    except for n > 2 are non-abelian (non-commutative)

Caleys theorem:
    every finite group is a subgroup of a Symmetric group.

Cycle Notation: 
    simplifies the above notation

    |1 2 3 4|
    |4 3 1 2| 
    to 1->4->2->3->1 shortens to (1 4 2 3)

    |1 2 3 4 5|
    |3 5 4 1 2| 
    1->3->4->1, 2->5->2 shortens to  (1 3 4)(2 5) a product of two cycles

    (1 3 4) a 3-cycle 
    (2 5) a 2-cycle (transposition)

    (2 4 1)(3)(5) , 3 and 5 can be omitted for short-hand as they don't change any numbers

    the order of the cycle doesn't matter, when all cycles have unique elements pairwise (they commute)

    (2 5)(1 3 4)

Direct Product of Groups:
    take G1 and G2, then the direct product is x in G1 and y in G2 such that 
    (x,y) in G1 * G2 (the cartesian almost, not really)

    say G1 uses multiplication and G2 uses addition then, to find entries we do 

    (x1,y2) * (x2,y2) = ((x1*x2),(y1+y2)) in G1 * G2, only groups function on themselves. The 
    group product is are all permutations of (x,y) pairs added against all other pairs. Hence 
    the size of G1 * G2 is |G1| * |G2|

    if infinite order, is in one, then the product is infinite

    if one group is non-abelian, then the result is non abelian.

FTA on Groups:

    just how numbers can be factored into primes (you may think of primes as the building blocks).
    This too can be done with groups, using simple groups on finite groups.

    to start, we preform such on G, find a maximal normal subgroup N1 of G. This means this 
    is the biggest possible normal subgroup of G such that no other H betwen N1 and G could be made.
    This N1 is also a proper subgroup (smaller than G).

    Create a series of these max proper normal groups from N1 until the trivial group is made. Each 
    sub group a child that is max and proper to its parent. 
    1 <|...<| N4 <| N3 <| N2 <| N1 <| G
    this is called a "normal series"
    the longest of these chains are a "composition series"

    Jorden Holder Theorem states, that there may be multiple composition series 
    though all of them are identical, just in different order.

    In a composition series each group is a Simple 
    
    Finite simple groups Z/pZ, as Z/pZ is mod p for p prime. 
    it has order p. though it's composition series consists of only two elements 
    p itself and 1, as p cannot be broken into any smaller normal subgroups then such. 

Ring: 

    a set of elements which, 
    - closed under addition as an abelian group
    - closed under multiplication 
      semi-group
      (not necessarily abelian, and not all elements may have inverses, associative)
    - Distributive Property (left and right)

Units: 
    the set of elements within a Ring which do have mult inverses. 
    This set forms a group under the operation. Denoted R^x (R to cartesian X)

Associate: 
    element times a unit = an associate.

Associates Usage in FTA or factoring:
    Associates help generalize FTA to negative numbers

Zero Divisors:
    we say a|b if a*k = b, 
    hence in mod 

    3*4 cong 0 (mod 12) is a zero divisor 

Factoring Rings:
    when there are no zero divisors you can solve by factoring and setting terms to zero 
    (polynamials) (x^2+5x+6) cong 0 (mod 11), 11 a prime, however, when there are zero 
    divisors you may mis solutions, (mod 12)

Integral Domain:
    - a commutative ring
    - mult identity 1
    - no zero divisors (enables cancellation and factoring)
    - cancellation property 
        a != 0
        ax=ay, ax-ay=0, a(x-y)= 0 by Distributive
        x-y must equal 0 as a isn't 0
        x=y (a is cancelled)

Domain: 
    a domain in abstract algebra is 
    an integral domain which does not require commutativity

Ideal:
    is a subgroup I of a ring R which 
    r in R and i in I 
    then ir in I 
    and ri in I

    so it acts as a normal group of rings, which the set of ideals form a Ring.
    So it is a subgroup closed under multiplacation, but it's not a subring as 
    it misses the identity element 1. (but don't rings not inherently have an identity? 
    is it that it doesn't have the additive identity?)

Fields: 
    (
        aside:
            +,- (group)
            +,-,x (ring)
            +,-,x,/ (field) 
    )
    F is a field with 2 operations
    <F,+> commutative addition 
    <F^x,*> commutative multiplication (excluding 0)
    closed under Distributive property

    building blocks are Rational numbers (Q) and prime modulus classes Z/pZ
    Q: infinite field (more Real numbers, Complex numbers)
    Z/pZ: finite field 

    anything built of of such, is an extension field
    if an extension of Z/5z "F has characteristic 3"
    if an extension of Q "F has characteristic 0"
